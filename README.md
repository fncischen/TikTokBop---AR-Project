 Where Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun meets AR Head Bopping

Inspired by how the TikTok / Douyin (抖音) AR Effects team has been using AR Face Tracking as an ad hoc game controller, I decided to create a TikTok AR Effect that combines both: the game mechanics of social music games such as Guitar Hero and Taiko Master (Taiko no Tatsujin); and, the natural head bop motions you see in concerts and raves to create TikTok Bop. 

The game is very simple: as the music begins playing, the timeline scrolls drum beats that you have to bop to. Each time you bop successfully, an AR filter will change the Material of the AR Avatar you are inhabiting.   

There are endless applications to these musical AR game mechanics. Games such as Taiko Master already have face emojis for players to beat the drum to, which means there are opportunities to leverage the ARKit Face Tracking Blendshapes to create a range of weights to match the player’s face with each emoji each time the song is playing.
